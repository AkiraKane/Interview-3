    N-Queens
    The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
    
    
    Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
    Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
    For example,
    There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle:

    Follow up for N-Queens problem.
    Now, instead outputting board configurations, return the total number of distinct solutions.
