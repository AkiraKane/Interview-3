    6.40    Sub-matrix sum
    Given a matrix of integers. How to calculate the sum of a sub-matrix. A sub-matrix is represented by x, y, h, w, where x and y is the position of the upper-left corner, h is the height, w is the width.
    int[][] matrix int sum(int x, int y, int h, int w){...}
    2. if this function is called frequently on the same matrix, how to optimise it?
