/**
    1.43    Longest consecutive sequence
    Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
    For example,
    Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
    The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
    Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
