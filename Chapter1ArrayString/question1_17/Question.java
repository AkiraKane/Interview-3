/**
    1.17    2SUM
    Design an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array which sum to a specified value.    
    (CareerCups150--17.12)
    Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2. Please note that your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.                                                        
    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

    Similar to Question [1. Two Sum], except that the input array is already sorted in ascending order.
    (CleanCodeHandbook--2)
     
    Design and implement a TwoSum class. It should support the following operations: add and find.
    add(input) – Add the number input to an internal data structure.
    find(value) – Find if there exists any pair of numbers which sum is equal to the value.
    For example,
    add(1); add(3); add(5); find(4)􏰁true; find(7)􏰁false
