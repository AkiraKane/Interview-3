/**
    5.12    Find Minimum in sorted rotated array
    Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
    Find the minimum element.
    You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

    If the rotated sorted array could contain duplicates? Is your algorithm still O(log n) in runtime complexity?
