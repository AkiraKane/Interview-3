/**
    4.19    Root-to-leaf Path Sum
    Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
    For example: Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,
    
    return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
