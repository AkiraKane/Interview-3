/**
    6.44    CTRL+A, CTRL+C, CTRL+V
    Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:
    A
    Ctrl+A
    Ctrl+C
    Ctrl+V
    where CTRL+A, CTRL+C, CTRL+V each acts as one function key for “Select All”, “Copy”, and “Paste” operations respectively.
    If you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), please write a program to produce maximum numbers of A. If possible, please also print out the sequence of keys.
    That is to say, the input parameter is N (No. of keys that you can press), the output is M (No. of As that you can produce).
