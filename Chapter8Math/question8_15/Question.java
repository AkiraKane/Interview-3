/**
    8.15    Randomization/Sampling
    Write a method to randomly generate a set of m integers from an array of size n. Each element must have equal probability of being chosen.
    (CareerCups150 -- 18.3)
    Reservoir Sampling
    There is a linked list of numbers of length N. N is very large and you donâ€™t know N.
    You have to write a function that will return k random numbers from the list. Numbers
    should be completely random. Hint: 1. Use random function rand() (returns a number
    between 0 and 1) and irand() (return either 0 or 1) 2. It should be done in O(n).
