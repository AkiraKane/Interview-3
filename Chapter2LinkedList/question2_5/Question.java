    2.5     Add two numbers
    You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
    EXAMPLE:
    Input: (3 -> 1 -> 5), (5 -> 9 -> 2)
    Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8
    FOLLOW UP
    Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
    EXAMPLE:
    Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).
    Output: 9 -> 1 ->2.  That is, 912.

    You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse old and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
    Input: (2->4->3)+(5->6->4)
    Ouput: 7->0->8
