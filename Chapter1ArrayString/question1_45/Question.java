/**
    1.45    There is an array A[N] of N numbers. You have to compose an array Output[N] such that Output[i] will be equal to multiplication of all the elements of A[N] except A[i]. Solve it without division operator and in O(n).
    For example Output[0] will be multiplication of A[1] to A[N-1] and Output[1] will be multiplication of A[0] and from A[2] to A[N-1].
    Example:
    A: {4, 3, 2, 1, 2}
    OUTPUT: {12, 16, 24, 48, 24}
