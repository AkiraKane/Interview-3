/**
    6.32    Largest rectangle in Histogram
    Given n non-negative integers representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, find the area of largest rectangle in the histogram.
    
    Above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1, given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3].
    
    The largest rectangle is shown in the shaded area, which has area = 10 unit.
    For example,
    Given height = [2,1,5,6,2,3],
    return 10.
     
    The best time complexity is O(n). If using the method of “division and Conquer”, it is O(nlog)
