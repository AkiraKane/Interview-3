/**
 * 2.5  You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input: (3 -> 1 -> 5), (5 -> 9 -> 2)
 * Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
 * EXAMPLE:
 * Input: (6 -> 1 -> 7) + (2 -> 9 -> 5).
 * Output: 9 -> 1 ->2.  That is, 912.
