    6.1     Subsets
    Get all subsets of a set.
    (CareerCups150 -- 9.4)                      
    Given a set of distinct integers, S, return all possible subsets.
    Note:
    Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
    The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
    For example,
    If S = [1,2,3], a solution is:
    [   [3],   [1],   [2],   [1,2,3],   [1,3],   [2,3],   [1,2],   [] ]

    SubsetsII
    Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, S, return all possible subsets.
    Note:
    Elements in a subset must be in non-descending order.
    The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
    For example,
    If S = [1,2,2], a solution is:
    [   [2],   [1],   [1,2,2],   [2,2],   [1,2],   [] ]
