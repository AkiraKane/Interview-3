    You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, and A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order
    (CareerCups150 -- 11.1)
    Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.
    Note:
    You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.
