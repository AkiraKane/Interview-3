/**
    4.10    BST Iterator
    Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.
    Calling next() will return the next smallest number in the BST.
    Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
