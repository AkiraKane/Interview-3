/**
    1.31    Maximum Subarray
    You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the continuous sequence with the largest sum, Return the sum.
    Example
    Input: 2, -8, 3, -2, 4, -10
    Output: 5 (i.e., {3,-2,4})
    (CareerCups150 -- 17.8)
     
    Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) that has the largest sum. For example, given the array [2, 1, –3, 4, –1, 2, 1, –5, 4], The contiguous array [4, –1, 2, 1] has the largest sum = 6.
    More practice:
    If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.
