/**
    1.42    Distinct Subsequences
    Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.
    A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).
    Here is an example:
    S = "rabbbit", T = "rabbit"
    Return 3.
