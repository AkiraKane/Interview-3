/**
    1.59    Read N characters Given Read4                   
    The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.
    The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there
    is only 3 characters left in the file.                                                      
    By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.                                        
    Note: The read function will only be called once for each test case.
