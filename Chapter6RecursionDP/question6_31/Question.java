/**
    6.31    Word Break
    Given a string s and a dictionary of words dict, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
    For example, given
    s = "leetcode",
    dict = ["leet", "code"].
    Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

    dict = ["cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog"].
    A solution is ["cats and dog", "cat sand dog"].
