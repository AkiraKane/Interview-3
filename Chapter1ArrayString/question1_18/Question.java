/**
    1.18    3SUM
    Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
    Note:
    Elements in a triplet (a,b,c) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a ≤ b ≤ c)
    The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.
    For example, given array S = {-1 0 1 2 -1 -4},      
    A solution set is:     (-1, 0, 1)   (-1, -1, 2)
    Note that (0, 1, -1) is not part of the solution above, because (0, 1, -1) is the duplicate of (-1, 0, 1). Same with (-1, -1, 2).
    For a set S, there is probably no “the” solution, another solution could be:
    (0, 1, -1)
    (2, -1, -1)
