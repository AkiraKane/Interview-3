/**
 * 6.3  Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of an X by Y grid. The robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible paths are there for the robot to go from (0,0) to (X,Y)?
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Imagine certain spots are "off limits", such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.
 * (CareerCups -- 9.2)
 * A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m × n grid (marked ‘Start’ in the diagram below). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked ‘Finish’ in the diagram below). How many possible unique paths are there? 
 * (CleanCodeHandbook--43)
 * Similar to Question [43. Unique Paths], but now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?    
 * An obstacle and empty space are marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid. For example,
 * There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3×3 grid as illustrated below.
 * The total number of unique paths is 2.
