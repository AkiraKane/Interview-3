/**
    1.16    Palindrome Partitioning
    Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
    Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.
    For example, given s = "aab",
    Return
      [     ["aa","b"],     ["a","a","b"]   ]

    (leetcodecpp10.1)
     
    Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome.
    Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.
    For example, given s = "aab",
    Return 1 since the palindrome partitioning ["aa","b"] could be produced using 1 cut.
