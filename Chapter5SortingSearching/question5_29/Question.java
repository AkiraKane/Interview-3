/**
    5.29    Sort a nearly sorted array
    Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position, devise an algorithm that sorts in O(n log k) time. 
    For example, let us consider k is 2, an element at index 7 in the sorted array, can be at indexes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the given array.
