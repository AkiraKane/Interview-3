/**
    3.4     Min Stack
    How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.
    (CareerCups150 - 3.2)
    Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
    push(x) – Push element x onto stack.
    pop() – Removes the element on top of the stack.
    top() – Get the top element.
    getMin() – Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
