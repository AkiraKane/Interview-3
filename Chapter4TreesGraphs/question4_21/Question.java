/**
    4.21    Sum root to leaf numbers
    Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.
    An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.
    Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.
    For example,
    
    The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
    The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
    Return the sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
