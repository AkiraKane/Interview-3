/**
    6.41    Viewable blocks
    You are given N blocks of height 1..N. In how many ways can you arrange these blocks in a row such that when viewed from
    left you see only L blocks (rest are hidden by taller blocks) and when seen from right you see only R blocks?
    Example given N=3, L=2, R=1 there is only one arrangement {2, 1, 3} while for N=3, L=2, R=2 there are two ways {1, 3, 2}
    and {2, 3, 1}.
